# Moneyball!

This exercise utilized the pandas library to create an ultimate moneyball team.
We took csv files with baseball statistics from 1871 to 2014 and picked a year
in which to field our team. I picked 1985. We then created a team of 9 different
players who played 9 unique positions and had the highest OBP and the lowest
salaries.

If you want to just view the Ipython file, you can do so right from Github.
If you'd like to manipulate the file yourself, you can download the requirements
by entering pip install -r 'requirements.txt' from your terminal.
